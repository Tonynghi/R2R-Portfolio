            Originally born in a farming village, Po was separated from his
            family at birth. He was eventually found by Mr. Ping, who adopted
            him, hoping for Po to inherit the family noodle shop some day.

            However, Po was drawn to kung fu, and his unwavering enthusiasm led
            him to be chosen as the Dragon Warrior, after which he began
            training under Master Shifu.
